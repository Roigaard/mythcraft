| **Book Of Legends**          | Troubadour Entry         | You have a special tome, your Book of Legends. The tome is magical and cannot be destroyed or damaged by mundane means.<br><br> Gain **Summon Character (2/Rest)**: Spend 3 AP to magically call forth a spirit that takes the form of a character from this tome. <br>This creature appears in an unoccupied space within 20 ft of you and has the stats of any ML 2 or lower creature with only the beast tag or is a NPC.<br> A Summoned Character loses any magic from the Five Sources that its stat block would normally allow. <br>It is a corporeal spirit and possesses any equipment that the stat block would normally have. <br>This equipment is corporeal while the creature is holding it or using it in a thrown or ranged attack, <br>but the equipment fades into nothingness if any other creature tries to use it. <br>The character lasts for 10 minutes, until it is dismissed by spending 1 AP on your turn, or until it is reduced to 0 HP. <br><br>This talent gives you +5 SP and +1 Arcane or Psionic Power (your choice), but does not grant you spells. | Troubadour, Legend Keeper           |

| **Astounding Critical**        |                          | When you crit and roll max damage on a damage die, set that die aside and roll another die of the same type. <br>Repeat this process until there are no new maximum dice, then add the sum of all those dice together.  <br>Your range for critical failure doubles (for example, from 1 to 2, or from 2 to 4). <br>Critically failing an attack immediately ends your turn, regardless of remaining AP. | Combat, Crit |
| **Go For The Knees**           |                          | When you crit against a creature with a weapon attack, it is **Slowed** until the end of its next turn.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Combat, Crit |
| **Gore**                       | Bull Rush                | If you crit with the attack made as part of your **Bull Rush**, the target is automatically knocked **Prone**,<br> and you may immediately make another attack against that creature without expending AP.                                                                                                                                                                                               | Combat, Crit |
| **Impale**                     |                          | If you crit with a two-handed melee weapon that deals sharp damage, make a secondary DEX attack against the target’s FORT. <br>On a hit, the target is **Grappled**.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Combat, Crit |
| **Opportunistic Crit**         |                          | If you crit using Reactive AP, you retain up to **3 Reactive AP** and may attack again if <br>you have sufficient AP and the triggering conditions are still met.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Combat, Crit |
| **Slow And Steady**            |                          | You gain **+1 damage** on all damage rolls, but you can no longer crit. This bonus increases by +1 at levels 10, 20, and 30 (to a maximum of +4).                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Combat, Crit |
| **Training Meets Opportunity** | Weapon Expertise, LUCK 2 | While you have **0 Luck Points**, your crit range increases by +1 with weapons you have Weapon Expertise in.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Combat, Crit |

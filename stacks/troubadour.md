**Stanzas**

* When you gain the ability to use Stanzas, choose Auditory or Visual. If Auditory, creatures must hear you to be affected; if Visual, they must see you.
* Stanzas cost 1 AP.
* Stanzas last until the end of your next turn unless otherwise noted.
* A Stanza’s base range is 40 ft.
* You can use the same Stanza multiple times in one turn, and can use different Stanzas on the same turn.
* A creature can only be affected by one Stanza at a time. If you use a Stanza on a creature already under the effects of one of your Stanzas, your old Stanza ends. If they are under the effects of a Stanza from another Troubadour, roll CHA against the other Troubadour’s WILL. On a hit, your Stanza takes effect. On a miss, you lose your 1 AP and there is no effect.
* If you use a Stanza with the scorn tag, make a CHA attack against the creature’s WILL. On a hit, the Stanza takes effect.

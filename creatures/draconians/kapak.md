# Draconian, Kapak

Monster Level ?, Medium Humanoid

Created for stealth warfare and surgical precision strikes, taking out
high value targets as hit-and-run skirmishers on the battelfield or as assasinas off the battlefield.
Armed with venomous bite and spit, the Kapak create chaos and confusion.
Should they fail in their mission, their death will inevitably distrupt enemy lines.

4. Sivak Draconian

Role & Narrative:

Elite warriors with special abilities; stronger and more versatile than Baaz or Kapak.

Shape-changing or mimicry effects in death make them psychologically frightening.

Often serve as shock troops or bodyguards for higher-ranking dragonarmy leaders.

Game Mechanics:

Death Throes: Transformative rather than damaging.

Slain by humanoids: corpse becomes an exact duplicate of killer.

Slain by non-humanoids: reverts to twisted draconian form.

No damage; no save.

Combat stats: superior strength, claws, and melee abilities compared to Baaz/Kapak.

Not winged in most depictions; some Sivaks have limited aerial capabilities in special scenarios.

Combat Traits:

Strong melee fighters; may take front or flanking positions.

Can exploit fear or confusion caused by death mimicry.

Often serve as squad leaders for Baaz units or coordinate attacks with Bozaks.

Etymology (Speculative):

“Sivak” — sibilant “Si-” evokes danger or stealth; “-vak” connects with draconian naming pattern; reflects elite, exotic, and menacing nature.

Tactical Notes:

Psychological weapon: death mimicry can cause hesitation or confusion among enemies.

Strong in melee and durable.

Less common; typically appear in smaller, elite units.

3. Bozak Draconian

Role & Narrative:

Magical officers of the dragonarmies; often coordinate tactics and provide magical support.

Highly intelligent and dangerous due to spellcasting and explosive death throes.

Commonly deployed alongside Baaz or Sivak to enhance front-line effectiveness.

Game Mechanics:

Death Throes: Explodes in magical energy.

AD&D 2e: 3d6 damage in 10-foot radius, save vs. spell for half.

3.5: 3d6 force or magical damage, Reflex half.

5e: 10-foot radius, 3d6 force, Dex save for half.

Spellcasting:

Typically offensive and defensive spells (magic missiles, protective shields, fire bursts depending on edition).

Bozaks are often built as wizard/sorcerer equivalents in 3e/5e.

Combat Traits:

Moderate melee capability, but often avoid direct frontline unless necessary.

Do not use wings; rely on positioning and tactical magic.

Explosive death throes make them highly dangerous in tight formations.

Etymology (Speculative):

“Bozak” — “Bo-” prefix heavier and more serious; evokes “blast” or “boom” to reflect magical and explosive nature.

Tactical Notes:

The most dangerous common draconian due to AoE death effect.

Placement near enemy melee troops maximizes threat.

Spellcasters enhance flexibility and battlefield control.
